# GameZone Smart Contract

## Overview

The `GameZone` smart contract is designed to manage user access and functionality within a gaming ecosystem. It provides features for allowing and disallowing users, as well as enabling a buy-and-sell mechanism through the `BuyZone` and `sellZone` functions.

## Contract Details

- **Owner**: The contract is initialized with an owner, and certain functions are restricted to be callable only by the owner using the `onlyOwner` modifier.

- **User Access Control**: The contract maintains a mapping of allowed users using the `allow` mapping. The owner has the ability to grant or revoke permission for specific users using the `allowUser` and `removeAllow` functions, respectively.

- **Buy and Sell Mechanism**: Users can interact with the contract by invoking the `BuyZone` and `sellZone` functions. The `BuyZone` function allows users to engage in specific actions, while the `sellZone` function provides a mechanism for users to sell their privileges or assets. The `sellZone` function checks whether the user has previously acquired the buyZone privilege.

## Functions

### `allowUser(address user)`

Allows the contract owner to grant permission to a specific user, enabling them to interact with certain features.

### `removeAllow(address user)`

Allows the contract owner to revoke permission from a specific user, restricting their access to certain features.

### `BuyZone()`

Enables users to engage in specific actions or privileges, provided they have been granted permission by the contract owner.

### `sellZone()`

Allows users to sell back their privileges or assets. The function checks if the user has previously acquired the buyZone privilege. If true, the privilege is revoked; otherwise, the function fails using `assert`.

## Ownership Control

The contract owner has exclusive control over critical functions, safeguarded by the `onlyOwner` modifier. This ensures that certain actions can only be executed by the entity that deployed the contract.

## Usage

1. **Deployment**: Deploy the contract to the Ethereum blockchain.

2. **Owner Functions**: The contract owner can manage user permissions using `allowUser` and `removeAllow`.

3. **User Interaction**: Users can use the `BuyZone` and `sellZone` functions based on their permissions.
